    #    inner shell's PPID is the ghost-complete binary itself.

    #    prompt). spawn.rs sets GHOST_COMPLETE_PANE=$TMUX_PANE in the child
    #    env; subshells inherit it. A new tmux pane gets a fresh env without
    #    this variable, so it correctly launches a new proxy.

    # in tmux — set by proxy.rs (tmux setenv) for future-pane propagation,
    # and inherited from the outer terminal shell that launched tmux.

    # typed at the prompt still hit the guard via their grandparent
    # ghost-complete process. If the walk is inconclusive (ps failure),

    # is more important than recovering from a leaked env var.
